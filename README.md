# Spatio Temporal CellularConnectivity
Mobile ISPs provide coverage maps for various technologies
they provide. However, it is observed sometimes that even if
a particular location is covered by, say, 4G technology, you
might not always be connected to a 4G network. In this
project, we tried to study the consistency of such coverage
and possibly discover patterns to explain the problems in
hand-off or with the device.
